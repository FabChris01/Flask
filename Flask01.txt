=> My Takeaway:

    - Flask is a Python framework for creating web applications
    - Open Source
    - based on WSGI toolkit and Jinga template
    - It's a micro framework that doesn't provide as much functionality as django but is much easier and simpler to use
    
    - Installed Flask
    - Implemented a Site as in "Flask01.py" that contains 3 routes
            - A Home page, A Custom Name Display Page and a Redirect Admin Page
